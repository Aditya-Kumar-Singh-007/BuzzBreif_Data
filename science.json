These engineered materials offer precise control over lights behavior, but many conventional designs are held back by inefficiencies. Typically, they rely on local resonances within individual nanostructures, which often leak energy or perform poorly at wide angles. These shortcomings limit their usefulness in areas like sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum technologies.",

The more the brightness dips, the larger the planet in relation to the star. This transit method is so effective it is how we have found the majority of exoplanets.

      "description": "New research from Houston Methodist reveals how obesity may directly drive Alzheimer’s disease. Scientists discovered that tiny messengers released by fat tissue, called extracellular vesicles, can carry harmful signals that accelerate the buildup of amyloid-β plaques in the brain. These vesicles even cross the blood–brain barrier, making them powerful but dangerous connectors between body fat and brain health.",
