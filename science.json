As a fundamental building block of the universe, a key question for astronomers is whether dark matter is smooth or clumpy, as this could reveal what it is made of. Since dark matter cannot be observed directly, its properties can only be determined by observing the gravitational lensing effect, whereby the light from a more distant object is distorted and deflected by the gravity of the dark object.",

A research team at Heidelberg University's Center for Organismal Studies (COS), in cooperation with partners at Nanjing Agricultural University (China), has discovered that a protein complex—the cysteine synthase complex—serves as a sensor in the chloroplasts. It receives and forwards stress signals and ensures that the hormone abscisic acid is formed via biosynthesis. This hormone triggers the closure of tiny pores on the leaves, thus preventing water loss.",

A new study published online on September 2, 2025, in the Geology journal, sheds light on this mystery by looking deep inside Martian craters, which act like \"ice archives\" that store a frozen record of the planet's past. These craters reveal that Mars went through repeated ice ages over hundreds of millions of years; however, with each cycle, the amount of remaining ice decreased steadily.",

Market participants and media reports have often highlighted that the policy distorted market valuations. At the same time, they pointed out that ETF management appeared to accelerate stock lending activity as the number of ETFs held by the Bank of Japan increased over time. This pattern suggests that the stock market, particularly the lending market, has mechanisms that enhance market efficiency and counteract the effects of the Bank of Japan's policy.",
