      "title": "Take a flight over the Martian surface with the Mars Express orbiter",
      "description": "For more than twenty years, the Mars Express orbiter has studied the Red Planet and remains the European Space Agency's (ESA) only operational mission. In that time, it has provided the most complete map of the Martian atmosphere and its chemical composition. It has also studied Mars's innermost moon (Phobos) in stunning detail, and traced the flow channels, delta fans, and chaos terrain that demonstrate that liquid water once flowed on the planet's surface. In addition, the images taken by the orbiter have been used to create detailed mosaics that have breathtaking 3D views of the landscape.",

In cosmological terms, this essentially means that Earth is representative of the norm, and life is likely to exist throughout the cosmos. While our efforts to find extraterrestrial life, a field of study known as astrobiology, have yielded no results so far, these efforts have been limited in scope.

Arsenic (As), although naturally occurring, becomes widespread when mobilized by mining. Abandoned gold mines are major sources, releasing arsenic-rich minerals into surrounding environments through erosion and leaching. Forest soils, essential for ecosystem health and biodiversity, are particularly vulnerable. Despite arsenic's mobility under specific soil conditions and known toxicity, its behavior in forest soils and impacts on soil organisms...",

Today, we know this to be the jet of the black hole M87*. Such jets are also emitted by other black holes. Theoretical astrophysicists at Goethe University have now developed a numerical code to describe with high mathematical precision how black holes transform their rotational energy into such ultra-fast jets.",

      "description": "Researchers have engineered a novel M6L4 octahedral molecular cage by integrating photoactive cyclometalated platinum(II) units, creating a visible-light-responsive \"nanoreactor\" that drives highly efficient photochemical reactions through precise molecular confinement. This innovative design overcomes the limitations of previous hosts, achieving perfect stereo- and site-selective cross-[2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions, and most notably, enabling catalytic cross-[2 + 2] cycloaddition of chemically inert substrates using this supramolecular confinement approach.",
