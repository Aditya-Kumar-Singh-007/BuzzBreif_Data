      "title": "Lessons from a historic quest to heal spider bites are helping to fight neglected tropical diseases today",
      "description": "The bite of a black widow spider can initially feel like a sharp stabbing pain, or it can be deceptively subtle, barely registering notice. But as the spider's potent neurotoxin courses through the bloodstream, some unlucky human victims begin to develop severe symptoms. Within about an hour, the venom can cause widespread body pain, stiffness and muscle spasms, or trouble breathing.",

      "description": "In business, marketing and social work, financial incentives are often used to increase people's motivation, guide their behavior and achieve lasting success. However, the latter is not always the case, as a recent study in Royal Society Open Science by the University Hospital of Würzburg (UKW) shows. Prof. Dr. Grit Hein and her team at the Center for Translational Social Neuroscience at the Center for Mental Health (ZEP) investigated whether people from a particular group would approach a foreign group if they received money for doing so.",

      "description": "Astronomers have identified an enormous \"growth spurt\" in a so-called rogue planet. Unlike the planets in our solar system, these objects do not orbit stars, free-floating on their own instead. The new observations, made with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (ESO's VLT), reveal that this free-floating planet is eating up gas and dust from its surroundings at a rate of six billion tons a second. This is the strongest growth rate ever recorded for a rogue planet, or a planet of any kind, providing valuable insights into how they form and grow.",
